# Grokking Algorithms In Swift
This repository contains sample code written in Swift based on the book, "[Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)", by Aditya Bhargava, published by Manning.

The original sample code in Python, which the book's examples are based on, are linked from the publisher's page.

Each chapter has its own Playground page for specific examples and exercises.
